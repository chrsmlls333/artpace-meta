Being the product of a family of intergenerational migrants and having to frequently re-locate due to financial instability, he attempts to transform spatiotemporal dislocation and intersectionality into agency, resistance and autonomy by vocalizing and embodying the experiences of the marginalized, disenfranchised, or liminal Other. His work, ranging from video installation to performance and text, incorporates music and storytelling, and brings to the foreground time, labor and rhythm. Combining personal narratives with those of his grandmother, Almendárez uses the biographical to collapse and juxtapose past, present and future, subtly touching upon underlying, overlapping and recurring themes from postcolonialism to migrant labor to gender roles and motherhood. Working from the vantage point of both insider and outsider, he observes, he listens, and he collects. Then, he transforms the material from the personal to the political – and finally – to the poetic, in the effort to re-present and re-historicize alterity, and provide an alternative to the dominant Western narrative.
Almendárez has participated in national and international exhibitions and screenings including Nuestro Hogar: Francis Almendárez and Ana Fernandez, Jonathan Hopson Gallery, Houston, TX (2019); The Potential Wanderer, The Reading Room, Dallas, TX (2019); Voices of Our Mothers: Transcending Time and Distance, Houston Center for Photography, Houston, TX (2018); Sisyphus, Ver.20.18, National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, Taichung, Taiwan (2018); Family Reunion, Pi Artworks, London, UK (2017); Videosubbota-2, CCI Fabrika, Moscow, Russia (2017); and Le Paradis, un peu plus loin, GALERIE DIX9, Paris, France (2017).

He recognizes that mass media exploitations and religious dogmas are designed to manipulate the public by provoking anxiety and encouraging shame.

Mary Jane Jacob
Hence the reason why I am interested in revisiting history as a means of understanding current times, as a means of comprehending the reality I live in and I am part of, aiming at defining the future.
The One event, out of the intricate weave defining my reality that has drawn my attention most particularly is also one whose importance has been diminished through the years in people’s memory, despite the strong evidence of its existence and the proportion of its implications as a symbol of the ferocious arrival of modern times.
Towards 1895, the Grand Central National Foundry is settled in Aguascalientes, Mexico. Dedicated to the processing of cooper and lead extracted from mines in the towns of Tepezala and Asientos, this foundry was presented by the government as a beacon of progress for this small city, therefore concessions and exemptions were granted, aiming at producing profits for a town full of people willing to work and find wellbeing. 30 years were just about enough for the complete depletion of the resources the company was interested in, which brought about abandonment.
Tepezalá is now just a collection of piles of pebbles and stones under which people still live. There are still Industrial residues that for many of the inhabitants of Aguascalientes have just always been a part of the landscape, a perennial presence. In the world, there are 4 renowned museums holding the same last name, venues that represent that transition from hope to disappointment: Guggenheim.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/Rolando-Lopez_photo_gris-470x627.jpg

Inspired by nature, domestic life, and the fluidity of paint, his dream-like videos fuse the traditional medium of painting with high-definition photography. While pieces such as Stumble (2009) depict a recognizable subject (a painterly beetle righting itself), other pieces such as Landscape (2010) employ a minimal sense of realism with a vague strip of land passing beneath a bird’s eye view. Regardless of subject matter, all of his animations highlight luscious brushstrokes, swaths of saturated color, and paint droplets.

Her compositions are often comprised of political, social, and personal materials that result in the possibility of seeing multiple histories embedded in sculptural, architectural, and even abstract forms. Mundane objects and structures open into complex systems of knowledge; this perceptual slippage is what attracts her to both the illusions of film (still and moving photography) and the undeniable presence of physical objects (sculpture). Exploring this as an artist and not as a historiographer, she draws parallels between the formal appearance of things and their significance to collective history and political consciousness in contemporary art.
Hewitt graduated from The Cooper Union School of Art in 2000. From 2001-2003, she was a Clark Fellow at New York University in the Africana and Cultural studies programs. She received her MFA from Yale University.

In his early years as an art student, he asked, “What is there left to make when there is already so much stuff in the world?” Aware of excess, he questioned the necessity of his own possessions. As a cathartic personal exercise, he began to bring all of his belongings into the studio for installation, including items left at this parents’ house or gifts and things kept in storage. The ontological practice seemed to assert: “Here I am, at this time and place”-much like the work of conceptual artist On Kawara, who made this textual declaration in postcards decades before.
For Slotawa, material culture, and specifically his own personal possessions, represent a rich, recyclable resource for sculptural forms and installations. Before the idea of an ecological footprint, he was already tracking what this meant concretely in his daily life in Berlin. His belongings, in their new role as “art,” found new functions and performative qualities and iconography. In one museum show, he mapped out Michelangelo’s The Last Judgment in piles of personal objects; for another, he created an even more abstract work, inspired by Piet Mondrian’s Pier and Ocean. Throughout his process, he photographed aspects of the exhibition and re-installed these images to provide new angles into their carved-out space. Eventually, his continual practice responded more specifically to the received circumstances with which he was presented. In a museum project in Switzerland, he invited the director to displace her entire collection of personal possessions, thus challenging the hierarchy of artist and institution. More and more, his work dealt with museum collection strategies and curatorial functions, as well as the art market, in unusual ways.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/FSlotawa_proc_RR_005_crop-470x470.jpg

Specific reproducible media such as silkscreen, ceramic sculpture, language-based performances, videos, and the written essay have provided the frame for his engagement with historical narratives and revisionism. Oftentimes these familiar cultural tropes are visual signifiers for the canonical structures he aims to dismantle. Merging forms of Modernism, Minimalism, and Conceptual art of the ’70s with work from the Black Panther movement, queer herstories, and Latin American political dissident literature, he offers a proposal for another trajectory of history and future, one reorganized by subjective order. It is in this charged “what if” territory that new geneologies emerge, such as with the diptych Black Dada(2008) or with a black version of Sol LeWitt’s Incomplete Open Cubes. The work pivots on the friction created by opposing intentions and timelines of those references and forms. In a 2008 interview in The Highlights, he explained, “I want to juxtapose peoples, moments, events, and even forms with historical periods where their influence or presence is often not considered and at times (un)acknowledged.”",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/03.21.12_IAIRopening_094_crop-470x470.jpg

At any given time, he may be working with video, sculpture, performance, and found material related to his subject of interest.

For his critically acclaimed Clean Hands Pure Heart (2005), he collaborated with musician Ghetto Priest to record a dub reggae rendition of celebrated Scottish lyricist Robert Burns’s famous songs Auld Lang Syne and The Slave’s Lament. In this and later works, Fagen melds the history of Scotland’s involvement in the slave trade with the present-day popularity of Caribbean music in the Scottish Isles, linking seemingly disparate cultures in an unexpected exchange of cultural formation.

His practice incorporates a variety of approaches, including sealing voids, compressing spaces, and opening and constructing walls. Often he uses natural phenomena such as air, light, water, and gravity to create poetic gestures that serve to connect the present with the past. In Sunlight/Substratum (2009), he redirected sunlight using mirrors through subterranean passages in the oldest building of the American Academy in Rome, Italy, where Galileo briefly worked. The piece was only viewable during a few minutes each day, when the sun was in position, thus contrasting centuries of the building’s existence with the fleeting moments of light.

More recently, he has become interested in the idea of “The New World,” and the ensuing after-effects of clashing cultures-specifically the characterization of cultures as they blend. For Cyrus, this interest is manifested in the results of creolization, hybridity, and the notion that cultures are becoming much more abstract and increasingly difficult to define.

Referencing both popular culture and the growth in pop psychology since the 1970s in her art, Collier is drawn to the previous lives that these typically secondhand artifacts reveal through the traces of their former use.

These complex interventions are often constructed of cardboard walls, false or revolving doors, mirrors, and other materials or devices used to simulate real space in film; the artist transforms them from imaginary, incomplete entities, experienced only by the eye, into whole realms of space experienced by the body as well. In a recent project, Hunting for Pheasants, currently on view at Tufts University Art Gallery, Medford, MA, Tomaszewski created a series of fictional film posters based on famous assassinations and installed them within a space negotiated by threading through a knee-high maze. The result is an atmosphere of disorientation, challenge, and speculation on what is real and what is fabricated.
Tomaszewski received his MFA from the Academy of Fine Arts, Poznan, Poland, in 1995. He has had solo exhibitions at Galerie Michael Wiesehöfer, Cologne, Germany (2008); Sculpture Center, Long Island City, NY (2007); Kunstforum Ostdeutsche Galerie, Regensburg, Germany (2007); and Kunstsammlungen Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany (2007).

His found object-based drawings and sculptures are constructed of images culled from internet search engines and items purchased at yard sales. Allen’s process begins, however, not with the found objects, but with the establishment of a general shape or form, which acts as the compositional framework for the assemblage. The shape is then filled in with a selection of random images-such as a diving board, stapler, or stuffed animal-resulting in a composition laden with associative possibility. Allen’s work is heavily informed by American consumer culture as well as Surrealist imagery.

Budd’s tangled masses of electronics, everyday objects, and lights are thus intended to evoke responses comparable to those linked with a Significant Emotional Experience (S.E.E.), a term coined by sociologist Dr. Morris Massey that defines “any major, fully associated, highly charged emotional event wherever it occurs.”

By drilling, folding, and collaging the materials, the artist makes evident the power of modification–encouraging the viewer to reevaluate commonplace perceptions of familiar objects and messages.
For instance, in a recent work Libri Tranciati (2006), Arienti sliced away all but the spines of over 100 books, stacking the rectangular shapes to construct a sculpture of colorful bindings and abbreviated titles.

Since the early 1980s, O’Grady has challenged racial and sexist ideologies in performances and photo installations that combine both opposition to philosophies of division and exclusion, and humanist studies of women throughout history.
In Miscegenated Family Album (1980-1988), the artist created a series of diptychs, juxtaposing photographs of her sister and nieces with images of Egyptian queen Nefertiti and her daughters. The obvious visual resemblance makes evident the continuity of a shared cultural heritage across thousands of generations, connecting the histories of countless peoples.

Condensing time and geography, the artist’s compositions reflect the methodic generation of political and social ideologies.
In Cartas por Sabina (Sabina’s Letters) (1998-2000), the artist has melded stills of video letters from his sister, family photographs, and the interior architecture of his apartment to create a visual journal¬ that evokes feelings of displacement and uncertainty. Reflecting a life defined by immigration, the images poignantly narrate the struggle to find meaning in a foreign place.

Strunz’s works depart from the rigidity of geometry to offer a conceptual exploration of the development of memory and the cyclic nature of history.
The dynamic wedged angles of Herbstzeitlose/Saffron Meadow (2005), a sculpture constructed of oxidized steelsheet, offer a visual representation of chronology. The work is a wall-bound group of isosceles triangles, a series of oblique metal forms that resemble folded paper. Strunz activates the multiple axes in this sculpture to explore the relationship between the obdurate material and the area surrounding the work. The resulting composition integrates positive and negative space to establish an environment in a state of constant flux—a corollary to the flexible relationship between space and time.

Though deeply informed by art history, this fantasy world of desire and terror looks forward to a mechanized future envisioned through a 21st-century vocabulary of computer-generated imagery.
Aoshima draws on the expanse and tranquility found in historical Japanese scroll painting while permeating each image with contemporary elements including an abundance of female protagonists and stylistic references to manga (comic books). The digitally saturated archival paper of Magma Spirit Explodes Tsunami is Dreadful (2004) fills an entire wall. The titular doe-eyed character explodes with fiery energy, indifferent to a city nearby being ravaged by a watery disaster. Panoramic in scope, the work seems alive: feisty women fly in the background and flames appear to breathe. Aoshima’s use of color, symmetry, and anthropomorphism turns the apocalyptic into the cathartic, the chaotic into the calm, and the futuristic into a natural state of being.

The myriad elements used in her projects, such as dolls, quilts, and uniforms, are handmade and labor intensive, foregrounding the role of craft in the construction of cultural identity.
Inspired by Civil War reenactments, recent performances have combined art and social activism to stage modern-day musters (rallies), asking uniformed participants, “What are you fighting for?” A related installation, Victory Hall (2005), included framed calligraphic war songs and a decorative wall pattern made of carved wooden rifles. Strewn upon a floor-painted compass rose were human-scaled porcelain dolls clothed as Zouaves, flamboyant male and female soldiers known for their eccentric uniforms and precision in battle. Smith navigates binary oppositions, like masculine and feminine, death and life, north and south, to both critique and celebrate.

Each site-specific project fuses discarded objects, plant material, chemical-solutions, dreams, and researched miracles into narrative platforms of charmed play.

Meditating upon architecture, Eastern thought, and autobiographical details, Suh’s poetic, large-scale works materially connect personal and collective identity.
One series of installations traces Suh’s unsettled Korean/American existence by fashioning details of his past residences–a Korean home, a New York apartment–in translucent nylon. Traveling from exhibition to exhibition, each life-size fabric replica becomes a vehicle for memory and belonging: a global security blanket and a transposable definition of self. Other projects extend this metaphor. Military dog tags amass into an armored gown, signatures into a saving parachute, and small figurines into a supporting floor, emphasizing human interdependence and inseparability.

Transforming ordinary materials (wax, cotton, mud, PVC pipes, plastic sheeting) into ethereal sculptures that mimic natural structures such as beehives and spider webs, Shettar fuses the mundane with the metaphysical. Whether examining the nature of inhabited space or the confrontation between facts and ideology, Shettar’s intricate works collapse distinctions between art and craft, yet draw liberally from the histories of both.
Shettar’s three-dimensional, sculptural drawings fluidly string together particles of divergent material to reveal their biological inspiration. Creating breadth from masses of small parts, the elegant installations move beyond the scientific to suggest contemporary social, and even geo-political, relations.

Giving visual expression to wordplay, Arceneaux’s Borrowed Sun (Critical Juxtaposition Test) (2004) places a pencil-drawn portrait of jazz musician Sun Ra on par with sketched representations of Sol LeWitt and Galileo, three legendary creators linked by cosmic connotations.

In his paintings, thick impasto inches across saturated canvases that have been continually sprayed and sanded. In his drawings, similarly labor-intensive pencil strokes are tirelessly repeated to create structures resembling defensive walls. Di Stefano’s works utilize paint’s sculptural potential and the gravity of singular marks to investigate actual and emotional barriers.
Di Stefano has historically exhibited variously-sized monochromatic paintings. In recent years he has begun presenting drawings simultaneously realized on portfolio paper, which he unstitches from its binding. Rather than drafts for his contemplative abstract paintings, the colder drawings of architectural fragments are works in their own right. Articulated with razor-sharp graphite on white, the detached images are softened by the intimate, book-like nature of still-creased paper.

Though he begins with research and documentation (of star-gazers in Utah or rap-enthusiasts outside of large cities), projects are ultimately realized in poetic, sculptural installations that involve viewers and present multiple views. Each element and work joins to the next like a constellation that describes who we are and how we interact.
Ohanian’s recent seven-channel video project Seven Minutes Before (2004) continues his relational investigation of the cosmos. The film presents seven synchronized visions emerging and converging on the same point, yet each along distinct paths. Beginning with the tale of a natural tragedy that occurred in the French Alps, the piece continues as the cameras fly concurrently over the sharp valley, scrutinizing rocks, roads, tunnels, and ruins. Narrative moments (a couple in silent ritual, a wolf in a cage) indicate a metaphorical structure that suddenly ends with related fiery explosions. The work suggests, as do many of Ohanian’s projects, that between the multitude of divergent experiences there are universal connections.

Past projects include a video of people explaining their scars, lawn sculptures made in the likeness of Fletcher’s neighbors, and a participatory website (www.learningtoloveyoumore.com) created with Miranda July that offers assignments including, “Grow a garden in an unexpected spot.” Each project suggests that artmaking is a subjective process of assigning value, something each of us does every day.
For a recent project in France, Fletcher subverted the usual artist/institution relationship by engaging community members to generate ideas for a local sculpture park commission. He ultimately elected to work with a nine-year old boy who proposed crafting a turtle of gold and painting it green. Fletcher’s contribution to the project involved casting the young man as the artist, helping him through museum negotiations, as well as overseeing the sketching, production, and installation of the new piece. This process, like each of Fletcher’s, opened up the sometimes closed-quarters of exhibiting art.

Whether translating bathroom graffiti into a planted garden or paint chips into a billboard the colors of the sky, the artist often explores artificial representations of nature and approaches each project with a delicate, spare hand that casts the familiar anew.
For her contribution to the recent 51st Venice Biennial Moorhead crafted On or About December 1981 (2005), a pair of iconic gull- wing doors from the short-lived DeLorean car, produced from 1981-83 in Northern Ireland. The artist revived the natural origins of this once-touted symbol of industrial utopianism by draining the car parts of their metallic and mechanical past. Sculpted in bass and plywood, the doors were removed from their adjacent body and lay isolated on the gallery floor like now-broken wings. This minimal work, like Moorhead’s others, is both poetic homage to intricate engineering and a melancholic exploration of the synthetic ways humans experience the natural world.
Born in Coleraine, Northern Ireland in 1971, Katrina Moorhead currently resides in Houston, TX. She received an MFA from Edinburgh College of Art, Scotland, in 1996. Solo shows include Inman Gallery (2006) and Devin Borden Hiram Butler Gallery, Houston, TX (2002, 1998).

His works’ formal austerity conjures comparisons with minimalist and conceptual art, but their subtle lyricism is more evocative of poetry.
Macchi teases meaning and melodies out of ordinary occurrences and everyday objects. The speed and sequence of cars streaming onto a five-lane highway generates a music box composition (Caja de música, 2003); the cracked pattern of glass broken upon a map structures an interactive tour of incidental urban highlights (Buenos Aires Tour, 2003). Macchi also adopts mass media as a source of raw material. In As folhas mortas (2004), newspapers whose texts have been excised hang like flimsy paper skeletons against the gallery wall, ephemeral grids that suggest the fragility (and flexibility) of truth. As eloquent as they are unassuming, Macchi’s works allow a variety of messages to be heard and read between the lines.
Jorge Macchi was born in 1963 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he lives and works. Recent solo shows include the Argentine Pavillion, 51st Venice Biennale, Italy (2005); Galería de Arte Ruth Benzacar, Buenos Aires, Argentina (2005); and Galería Luisa Strina, São Paulo, Brazil (2003).

His public projects activate iconic elements of the urban landscape, while related installations and publications employ print media, photography, and film to extend the works’ resonance beyond site specificity. In keeping with his dialectical approach, Vidokle acts alternately as artist, interlocutor, and instigator.
Vidokle’s work with logotype decals exposes the commercial and political cooptation of abstract forms once believed to embody revolutionary potential. By distributing stickers of commercial logos converted back into modernist geometries, Vidokle reinserts these once-utopian forms into the social fabric of the city. Popular Geometry, a newspaper series produced with Julieta Aranda in cities around the world, is a forum for debate over the global proliferation of minimalist public sculptures since the 1970s. These journals examine the disparate ways supposedly universal forms are transformed by specific cultural contexts.
Born in Moscow, Russia, in 1965, Anton Vidokle has lived in New York, NY, since 1981. He has had solo shows at Massimo Audiello, New York, NY (2004, 2001, 1999).

Snyder’s propensity for punning, coupled with his interest in means of making sense (and nonsense), infuse his work with insights that transcend everyday ironies to touch on universal themes.
Evoking associations that are as often literary, philosophical, or religious as they are political or art historical, Snyder’s projects expose hidden meanings in familiar images. Intrigued by the post-9/11 proliferation of patriotic symbols, Snyder spliced the striped portions of three US flags to create Ridge and Furrow (2003), whose title is an etymological play on the word delirium (from the Latin delirare, literally, “to go off the furrow”). His earlier Back to Basics (2001), a red, yellow, and blue acrylic guillotine, injects menacing undertones into modernism’s palette of primary colors. Sometimes cryptic but always good-humored, Snyder’s works generate narratives that ricochet off one another like reflections in a hall of mirrors.

Through architectural interventions, videos, and collages, his projects transfer forms from one context to another. These pieces create a sense of the uncanny and emphasize notions of temporality and space.

Replacing classical icons with symbols of contemporary pop culture such as taco trucks, canned beans, and an alter ego named Spaztek, Ortiz’s work maintains a tense relationship with consumerism and his heritage. One is never sure whether he is selling an idea, a product, or a revolution.
While much of Ortiz’s work has focused on the idea and efficacy of protests in the post-Civil Rights era, a related strain explores the type of melancholic love sung about in Conjunto, Tejano, and Country music. Through videos and prints Spaztek futilely chases amor just as protestors long to create change. With a methodological approach that often forsakes institutional space for guerilla tactics and public outreach, Ortiz’s work is multi-layered, cross-cultural, and unconventionally charged.

Her dialectical projects, primarily realized through video, connect contemporary society with recent social and political history.
One represents many in Tomic’s absorbing, large-scale projections. I am Milica Tomic (1998/99) explores the constructed, accidental necessity (Friedrich Hegel) of national identity. In the video loop Tomic successively repeats her name in various languages and takes on associated nationalities—Ich bin Milica Tomic, Ich bin Deutsch; Jaz sem Milica Tomic, Jaz sem Slovenka. Despite wounds miraculously appearing with each phrase confidently uttered, the artist calmly continues until her bloodied body transforms back to its pristine condition. The work not only evokes the violent and indestructible nature of statehood, but also a global dislocation of body, mind, perception, and reality. It, like Tomic’s other projects, reflects on geographic and cultural disparity, and suggests that through nationality and language the reality of both individuals and societies take shape.

Surreal and distinctive, the works at once reference ethnology, war, and portrayals of the female figure in mass media. Realized both on Mylar paper and directly on the wall, Mutu’s seductive hybrids—swan necks, talons for feet, distended bellies, mechanical appendages—use beauty to smuggle in the politics of violence and mutilation.
In the 1990s Mutu explored stereotypes of femininity and her African heritage through performative works. Since then she has primarily made drawings. That’s my death mask you’re wearing (2004) is emblematic of the collages—kaleidoscopic pools of reds and browns form a lithe female framed by tufts of savannah grass. The vamping body and magazine cutout eyes and lips imply glamour, yet swirls of ink create the impression of skin grafts. A missing arm, protruding prostheses, raw face, and heavy diamond earring support a darker narrative about the bloody effects of conflicts in Africa waged over scarce resources controlled by the West. Ever-sensuous, Mutu’s drawings are powerful critiques of contemporary media and cultural genocide.

Through sidewalk panels that reveal the past, a video of abandoned oil on the family ranch, or a sculpture made out of salvaged trees, Wallace connects mythology and history with present realities, and questions the individual’s role within the environment.
While Wallace has used video and sound to evoke place, in the 1980s/90s she produced a body of works with wood. The artist re-presented damaged trunks to highlight people’s affect on nature, but also to explore the raw realities of those on the U.S./Mexico border. As a human rights advocate living along the frontera for a decade, she imaged refugee’s stories through drawings and carvings. In Amando en Tiempo de Guerra (1989-91) a group of roughly hewn, life-size figures lament the fallen. Intermingled with smooth patches of wood are painful chainsaw marks signifying both physical and psychological injuries. This installation, like Wallace’s others in wood, sound, and video, empathetically explores an issue intimate to the artist and of broad social concern.

Since then she has produced eighteen cinematic works and countless photographs. Consistently playing with conventions of modernism and the classical avant-garde, she nurtures traces of the familiar and the unfamiliar, the real and the fantastic, allowing each to seamlessly intermingle with the others.
Many of Ottinger’s films explore issues of metamorphosis and inclusion. In Dorian Gray in the Mirror of the Yellow Press (1984) protagonist Dr. Frau Mabuse uses the power of prohibition to make and break the character of Dorian Gray, who ultimately undergoes a transformation from Bauhaus-dandy to evil tycoon. Ottinger complicates such familiar themes by reversing dominant gender roles and manipulating key transformative moments.
Ottinger has increasingly turned toward cultural studies, employing more documentary strategies in her photographs and films. In the film Exile Shanghai (1997) Ottinger documents the stories of six German, Austrian, and Russian Jews whose lives intersect when they flee to Shanghai. Employing interviews, narrative, photographs, and other documentation, the film capitalizes on the tension between art and ethnography.
Ulrike Ottinger was born in Konstanz, Germany in 1942.

These multicultural experiences dovetail with issues explored in his installations: identity and representation, as well as the idea of the social imaginary—a discourse about how human interaction fabricates a collective understanding of the world.
Maps are referenced both literally and metaphorically in Armaly’s work. In his 1999 project From/To, routes to and from a range of Middle Eastern cities were plotted in the real space of the gallery. As viewers moved through the installation, video, audio, and documentary material combined with structural elements to expose the Palestinian experience, particularly the physical and psychological barriers encountered on a daily basis. In this work, as in others, Armaly reveals how various components—namely architecture and media—intersect and overlap to form a space in which identity is created and comprehended.
Fareed Armaly was born in Iowa City, Iowa in 1957. Solo exhibitions include From/To, Witte de With, Rotterdam, NL (1999); BREA-KD-OWN, Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Belgium (1993); and re(Orient), Galerie Lorenz, Paris, France (1989).

The resulting works convey a sense of emptiness by exposing the overabundance of media images and the potential of consumerism to misdirect human desires.
Recently Varela has turned toward investigations of the moving image and its profound effect on the public. In Detritus, the Remix (1989/2002) viewers are forced to reckon with their intimate relationship to television. The installation requires them to look through a pair of peepholes in order to see Varela’s 1989 film Detritus. The struggle to gain access to the images—which depict death, fire-eaters, wrestlers, violent sections of cartoons, and gruesome scenes from Hollywood movies—symbolizes the consumer’s struggle to escape loneliness, as well as the futile search for fulfillment in goods and services. In this work, as in others, Varela implicates both the consumer and the media industry in perpetuating a system of empty promises.

en,Person,Michel François,Spring 2004 International Artist-in-Residence (International),https://www.artpace.org/artists_and_curators/michel-franois,IAIR Spring 2004,Brussels,"Brussels, Belgium","Through videos, photographs, books, and installations Michel François breathes new life into materials and spaces, as well as the act of creating and looking at art. François transforms otherwise static, white galleries into theatrical settings where holes appear in unexpected places and everyday items, purchased or scavenged, are poignantly juxtaposed.
François’ installations creep around doorways and through walls, mirroring the idea of the rhizome—a non-hierarchical, fluid way of operating theorized by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. As opposed to a vertical structure, such as a tree, a rhizome spreads laterally and diffusely, like a nettle. It has no top, no center, no culminating point. A rhizomatic structure is a series of interconnected nodes, and while some may be larger than others, none is ultimately most important. Like a rhizome, the distinct parts of François’ installations ebb and flow, receding and advancing to create entities that are in flux but nonetheless recognizable.
Revitalizing the familiar, François investigates the tension between public and private, and art and non-art. Stage lights, newspapers, plants, and tobacco reappear in various installations—at times becoming more or less important. For The Plant in Ourselves (2001) François pried into the history of a Nazi-era museum by exposing original marble and old walls. Lights shone on original details. A stately cactus brought organic matter into the art space. Visitors were given clay with which to mark up a room. In this installation, as in others, François refashioned the ordinary into the extraordinary. His amorphous, sculptural creation wavered between clarity and mystery—between explicit politics and beautification of the space.
Born and based in Brussels, Belgium in 1956, Michel François spends time in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where he teaches at the Rijksakademie. Recent solo exhibitions include the Westfälischer Kunstverein, Munich, Germany (2003); the Centre George Pompidou, Paris, France (2002); the Fundació Miró, Barcelona, Spain (2001); the Haus der Kunst, Munich, Germany (2001); the Kunstahalle Bern, Bern, Switzerland (2000), and the 48th Venice Biennale, Italy (1999).",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/MFrancois_IAIR_001_crop-470x470.jpg
en,Person,Oliver Herring,Spring 2004 International Artist-in-Residence (National),https://www.artpace.org/artists_and_curators/oliver-herring,IAIR Spring 2004,Brooklyn,"Brooklyn, New York, USA","Oliver Herring has captivated audiences with performances, knitted objects, and lyrical, movement-based videos. Under Herring’s hand these profoundly disparate media are intertwined and constantly tested. They become contemplative, sensual, and pregnant with issues of time and human intimacy.
The elegance of Herring’s sculptures, hand-knitted with strands of silver mylar or treated wood, is due to their laborious process and their soulful forms. After weaving a number of solitary objects that reference time and mortality (a queen-size bed, an open coat, an empty chair), Herring worked from video stills to imbue stationary objects with a sense of actual motion. Double Rocker (1999), a life-size rocking chair and body knit out of mylar, shows successive motions of rocking at once—the chair has two backs, and the person that has propelled it is physically shown twice. In the piece a static medium carries the expressive weight of a performance.
In 1999, breaking from the solitary act of knitting, Herring delved further into interactivity with video. Herring loosely choreographs people into synchronized actions that are filmed in stop-motion. The results are minutes-long, looped works that transform humans, movements, and props into compelling sequences. Increasingly he plays with the unpredictable. In the series Basic (2003) he took out ads inviting anyone interested to come work with him in his studio. The videos produced from the improvised sessions feature strangers thrown together into unrehearsed dance-like movements that are paired with music.
Oliver Herring was born in Germany. He received an MFA from Hunter College, New York, NY in 1991 and has lived there since. Solo exhibitions include Palm Beach Institute of Contemporary Art, FL (2002); the Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, OH (2001); the Camden Art Center, London, England (1997); the Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY (1996); and the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, NY (1993).

Over the past decade he has recorded himself and his surroundings, and composed environments that reflect his personal journey. Using readily available materials classically associated with craft—paper, plastic, felt-tip markers, tape—he creates all-encompassing, fictional worlds that explore the relationship between the self and the universe at large.
With each project Velliquette crafts a space-specific piece that encourages thoughts about humans and the world around us. To hasten the contemplation of metaphysics he employs a wealth of visual stimulants reminiscent of 1960s psychedelia and more recent rave culture. In his installation The Depth of the Drop (2003), a darkened room was crisscrossed by paper streamers printed with images of the galaxy. Projected on one wall was a video of a storm, while looped on a monitor was footage of a starry-eyed mummy singing sad soul songs. The work sparked thoughts about the afterlife and where we go from here. Like his other work, the piece used dramatic means to distill attention onto the intersection of science, cosmology, philosophy, and religion.
Michael Velliquette was born in 1971 in Sandusky, OH and has lived in San Antonio, TX since receiving his MFA from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2000.

Defying attempts at easy categorization, his work combines performance, video, sound, ephemera, and photographs into projects that excavate the history of a particular region. Deller’s process involves physically exploring a place and talking to the people who live there. The results of his research are woven into multi-media pieces that use people and their stories to depict the fabric of their land.
Deller’s last several projects have been investigations of the United States. After the Gold Rush (2002), created during a residency in California, is a tour book turned treasure hunt. The book and CD that comprise the project lead the reader/listener on a linguistic, sonic, and pictorial journey through northern California. Like the folk singers he admires, in this work, Deller spins a tale of the Golden State by celebrating its unknowns.
For This is us (2003), Deller explored upstate New York—an area, like San Francisco, with strong ties to folk culture. Working only with sound, Deller created an audio portrait of the area. He produced a CD and orchestrated a concert, bringing together various contributors to the region’s aural landscape—from a punk band and cheerleaders to birds of prey and a bluegrass group. In this and other works Deller unites diverse elements from an area, with the aim of offering a rich, albeit unconventional, version of place.
Jeremy Deller was born in 1966 in London, England. He studied art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, England, and later at University of Sussex, Brighton, England. Deller is the co-initiator of the Folk Archive.

In this ongoing series begun in the 1970s, he covers his naked body with mud and sticks, transforming himself into a walking sculpture. With a nod to Joseph Beuys, Jones brings this cryptic concoction of myth, organic material, and interactivity to the public—not only to art-goers but also to those he encounters while roaming the streets.
Jones’s object-based works are no less startling and evocative. Many similarly involve mutation and a messy-ing of the everyday. An early example is Calender (1975). Jones used felt-tip markers to transfer Mudman’s three-dimensional exoskeleton onto the pages of a pin-up calendar. Intricate webs of barbed sticks mar the clean, voluptuous bodies of the nude women, ultimately hiding them from view.
A similarly thorny tangle makes its way into Jones’s installations. In A Cripple in the Right Way May Beat a Racer in the Wrong One (1999), child-sized cars adorn the walls, but are rendered unusable by the wood, foam, tape, cord, and toy dolls that encase them. The jumble operates in much the same way as the sticks do in other works—it creates a nearly unbreachable, yet altogether intriguing, barrier between the art piece and the viewer.
Kim Jones was born in California in 1944. After returning from the Vietnam War, he earned a BFA from California Institute of Arts (1971) and an MFA from Otis Art Institute (1973), both in Los Angeles, CA. He has had solo exhibitions at The Sirius Art Centre, Cork, Ireland (2003); Pierogi Gallery, Brooklyn, NY (2002); and John Weber Gallery, New York, NY (1999).

O’Neil began her graduate studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago, IL making bold, abstract paintings in fashionable colors. While struggling to carve out her niche, O’Neil shifted from painting to drawing—leaving colorful brushstrokes for the shaded grays of pencil lines. She turned, purposefully, from the bold to the seemingly banal, from a costly medium to one she could work with anytime and anywhere. It was at this point, in the year 2000, that O’Neil started working with 10 x 12 inch drawings on paper.
Not only had Robyn O’Neil discovered her medium of choice, but she also found a subject matter that she would continue to explore. Her father and his friends became the base model for works that featured small groupings of men, clad in black sweat suits, captured in minimally articulated wilderness scenes. While the men seem to be the focus, they appear curiously unnatural and devoid of human emotions. In Diamond Leruso and Eddie Koynz (2000) two poker-faced characters ski dangerously close to craggy rocks; in Wrestlers and Miami Dave (2001) military planes zoom toward a field dotted by a lonely tree, two wrestlers, and a man doing calisthenics. What is causing the men to do these things? Why do they seem so unaware of the dangers around them? Is their world the same as ours? Rather than answering questions, O’Neil’s enigmatic images raise them.
Robyn O’Neil was based in Dallas, TX before moving to Houston, where she currently lives and works. O’Neil has had solo exhibitions at Clementine Gallery, New York, NY (2003) and at Angstrom Gallery, Dallas, TX (2001). She has been included in group exhibitions at the Dallas Museum of Art, TX (2003); Mixture Gallery, Houston, TX (2002); and at the Arlington Museum of Art, TX (2001). Her work can be seen in an upcoming solo exhibition at Inman Gallery, Houston, TX (2003-2004). The piece O’Neil produced at ArtPace will be shown in the 2004 Biennial Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/RONeil_proc_001_crop-470x470.jpg

Her most recent exhibition, Drawing Now: Eight Propositions at the Museum of Modern Art, Queens, New York highlighted 26 international artists. The exhibition posited that in the recent past drawing has eschewed the digitized, multimedia direction that much of contemporary art has taken, and has come to resemble more closely its pre-20th-century identity as a self-contained, finished thing.
While at MoMA, Hoptman also organized a number of contemporary art exhibitions including Love Forever: Yayoi Kusama, 1958-1968 (co-curated with Lynn Zelevansky of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1998) and Projects #60: John Currin, Elizabeth Peyton, Luc Tuymans (1997)—each was cited as one of the 10 best exhibitions of its year by ArtForum magazine.

Over a number of years Koo traveled four times to its mythic home, but the golden creature would not appear. Despite not having lain eyes on it, she knew it was there: Koo defended its existence to friends who came but did not see and protected its ancient status from scientific naysayers. Her constant belief was finally rewarded: on a fifth trip the wrinkled being emerged.
Koo’s ephemeral installations suggest rewards for the constant believers—for those with unwavering confidence in the existence of alternate realities. She breathes life into the usually inert, creating miniature worlds through ordered scatterings of such everyday material as aspirin, sugar cubes, cigarettes, and light.
In A Reality Upgrade & End Alone (2003), Koo’s piece for the 50th Venice Biennale, she carved out a space for subtlety in the midst of insistent politics. The artist brought the upper regions of two walls alive by embedding prismatic buttons into their cracks and crevices. These constellations sparkled with hope and made visible the state of in-betweenness: the realms that could be—and for Koo are—layered all around us.

The images arrive with no words—the photographs are presumed to tell the whole story. But does one moment captured on film convey the breadth of sights, sounds, and smells of a day spent at the pyramids? Years later will it remind the traveler of the particular glare of the Egyptian sun or the emotions felt in the face of such physical history?
Through various media Spencer Finch, a constant traveler and scholar of history, confronts the difficulties of “truly” representing a subjective experience. What does a photograph leave out? Can words on a page really do it? In many of his works the burden of memory often placed on photographs and language is transferred onto a less-considered and more interactive medium: light. A trip to the ancient site of Troy resulted in Eos (Dawn, Troy), (2002), an installation of fluorescent lights that fan out across the gallery ceiling to recreate the bluish tint of day breaking on the Trojan Plain.

The element of time is offered up for examination as the soundless continuous loops repeatedly emphasize particular movements. Moments in time are de-contextualized and imbue the figures’ actions with multiple meanings, challenging viewers to question what they see.
Pfeiffer implicates the viewer in all of us. He reminds us that in our obsession with and our knowledge of technology we collude in the media takeover we condemn. Through his video installations offer a slice of familiar part of contemporary culture and life, we know the players, we know the hooks, we see ourselves. In The Long Count, a three-part video installation based on footage of Mohammed Ali and in Race Riot, a video sculpture incorporating an excerpt following the Chicago Bulls victory during the 1996 NBA Championship, Pfeiffer has tapped into the undercurrents of pop culture that are shaped and propounded by the digital images that are a part of the visual vocabulary of contemporary American life.
“Like a guilty wish or an unconscious desire, technology is already deep inside you, ” Pfeiffer states. French philosopher, Guy Debord elucidates Pfeiffer’s work, and his words, in the 1967 treatise “The Society of the Spectacle,” when the author alludes to the function of the spectacle as “the total justification for the conditions and aims of the existing system.” Pfeiffer’s work compels the viewer to question his role: Is media “other” to community or are we essential to its success?

His black and white videos, which capture mysterious swirling patterns that emulate outer space, are grounded in an everyday occurrence: Fridge filmed rising steam and melting ice crystals in a state of transformation during his freezer’s defrosting process. Working in a low-tech way with a hand held 8 mm camera, Fridge has aimed to create works that possess a timeless and poetic quality, and he succeeds.
In speaking of his work and his own do-it yourself freezer cosmos, Fridge sets himself up as a kind of Zeusian figure or puppeteer when he claims that “the universe is useful because it is self-defined and at the service of nothing and is in this respect similar to art. Somewhere in the composition inside the texture of technology is the individual. The artist can use an object to mark the center of the universe as well as be its purpose.” Fridge’s work calls attention to the miraculous. We are engaged by the simple and by the complex beauty of the image. At the same time that we attempt to categorize his creations as natural, as man-made, as cosmic or concrete; they remain amorphous. The fact that his constructs are sometimes “natural,” other times manipulated, or a combination of both, is a means for drawing the viewer in for a closer look.
He began the development of inventive cosmological imagery in the earlier work from the Vault Sequence, where he used store-bought graphite-marked globes to create “toy models of cosmic events.”
Fridge explores the element of time by choosing to work in video and also enjoys the popular appeal and immediacy of a medium with a strong vernacular vocabulary.

Spring 1999 Hudson Showroom Exhibitor",https://www.artpace.org/artists_and_curators/chuck-ramirez,IAIR Spring 2002|HSR Spring 1999,San Antonio,"San Antonio, Texas, USA","Chuck Ramirez (1962-2010) lived and worked as an artist and graphic designer in San Antonio, Texas. Primarily employing large-scale photography, the artist’s body of work includes prints and sculptural installations. His pieces investigate the rituals and forms of everyday life and are charged with metaphors of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and religion. Ramirez’s involvement with Artpace dates back to 1999, when he first exhibited in the Hudson (Show)Room.
Ramirez’s spring 1999 Hudson (Show)Room exhibition, Long-Term Survivor, was an installation of digitally enhanced photographic works. The individual pieces explored the rituals of sustaining life and desire in the context of the AIDS crisis. Images ranged from abstractions of erotic toys to day-of-the-week pill boxes to leather chaps. Ramirez also presented a video piece on three monitors that displayed a spinning chrome ring-a seductive form that recalls corporate logos-against a bright red wall. Working with materials and images that are part of his daily life-a life impacted by being HIV positive-Ramirez transformed the language and power of advertising into a call for action and compassion, expression, and self-actualization.
Prior to the introduction of the WindowWorks program area at Artpace, Ramirez installed this street-facing façade space with a series of slim, netted Christmas trees during late 1999. Like the subjects of his photography, these seven freestanding trees featured everyday items such as spoons and forks. With this display, the artist posed the question: Where is the line between decorative and fine art?
In 2002 Ramirez was invited by guest curator Jérôme Sans, Co-director of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, France, to be the Texas representative for the New Works: 02.1 International Artist-in-Residence cycle. For his Artpace residency, Ramirez used a commercial studio to produce 17 large-scale photographs of items referencing food. The first series of 12 images consisted of images of raw meat-a whole chicken, sausage links, a beef steak-laid bare on the artist’s signature sterile white background. Two photographs featured empty candy trays that represented unattainable fulfillment and desire. He also displayed two full-frame images of fruit cocktail and green peas. Taken straight from the can, these fruits and vegetables are magnified to epic proportions; the mixed fruit recalling the complexities of multicultural mixing, and the peas signifying the sameness of humankind. A final image of a plastic cup from a fast food restaurant bears the epitaph When I am empty, please dispose of me properly, a somber parallel between life and consumption.
Ramirez continued his involvement with Artpace well after 2002 as a fundraiser and advocate for contemporary art. During our 10th anniversary in 2005, he took part in Artists Salute Artpace, featuring an auction of works by several former resident artists. His donation, Godiva 2, similar to Double Chocolate displayed here, was a large photograph of an empty chocolate box. Both pieces feature golden trays that once held chocolates yet sit empty, their irregular grids signaling a past function as containers for something else. These poignant reminders of time’s inevitable passage reference the traditional still life. They now take on additional meaning as the San Antonio art community mourns the recent loss of this visionary artist.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/CRamirez_crop-470x470.jpg

Pretty Vacant, his first narrative film, was released in 1996 and funded by San Antonio and San Francisco art grants. The film, about a Chicana punk rocker obsessed with the rock band Sex Pistols, was critically acclaimed and screened in numerous film festivals in North America, including the 2000 Havana International Film Festival and Generation ñ exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum. In 1997 he received a Rockefeller Intercultural Media Fellowship, and in 1999, Mendiola was awarded the Gateways Fellowship for documentary research on Mexican-American family photos in South Texas.
The artist’s second film, Come and Take It Day, was chosen for participation at the 2000 Sundance Filmmaker’s Lab and premiered in 2001 at the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center’s CineFestival in San Antonio. Funded by the Independent Television Service Project and PBS, Come and Take It Day will be broadcast nationally in spring 2002.

After attending the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, Conley was awarded an MFA in Sculpture and a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. He has exhibited his work widely throughout the United States and Europe, including solo exhibitions at Anthony Wilkinson Gallery, London, England; Zinc Gallery, Stockholm, Sweden; and Pierogi Gallery, Brooklyn, NY. Group exhibitions include War/Art/New Technologies, Pacific Northwest College of Art, Portland, OR (2000); Wild/Life, Weatherspoon Art Gallery, Greensboro, NC (1998); and Current/Undercurrent, Brooklyn Museum of Art, NY (1997). His radio broadcast, War! (1999), originally a live interactive sound performance between New York (radio WBAI) and Belgrade, Serbia (Radio B2-92), was recently featured in BitStreams at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY curated by Lawrence Rinder and Debra Singer. Conley currently lives and works in New York City.
From radio performance to sculptural and sound-based installations, Conley’s artistic practice operates between the divide of science and art. Appearing as anatomical models or artifacts from some future time, Conley uses scientific research and political inquiry to construct new morphologies that wryly challenge our perceptions of humanity, nature, technology, and consciousness.
Brian Conley was chosen for his ArtPace residency by Lisa Corrin, Chief Curator at the Serpentine Gallery, London, England. She has organized a number of significant shows for the Serpentine including solo exhibitions by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Chris Ofili, Jane and Louise Wilson, Bridget Riley, and an upcoming show of Rachael Whiteread. Corrin was recently appointed Deputy Director for Art/Jon and Mary Shirley Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Seattle Art Museum, WA.
In his work, Brian Conley complicates the natural order of things. Translating scientific research and data into abstracted simulations with humorous subtexts, Conley consistently renders the natural unnatural and the serious absurd. From large-scale sculpture to live-radio broadcasts and interactive sound installations, Conley’s work presents unlikely circumstances as logical possibilities for locating human experience within a continuum bounded by technology and nature.
Continuing an investigation into evolution and the divide between animals and humans, Conley’s project for ArtPace centers on a species of frog and its distinct mating call. Using research from both zoology and neuroscience, Conley has constructed a room-sized mechanical sculpture based on a frog’s vocal communication system.
In this installation, the viewer enters a dimly lit exhibition space. Emerging from the shadows is a 15-foot tall aluminum contraption attached to a large orange cloth draped across the floor. Inside this low-tech structure sits a row of wooden organ pipes and a wide, funnel-like horn. Activated by the viewer’s entrance into the space, the cloth sack quickly inflates to a 10 x 24-foot balloon, simulating an oversized vocal pouch. Voluptuous and intimidating, its overwhelming size reverses the typical human/animal dynamic suggesting instead a giant frog and a small human being.
As the balloon slowly deflates, it forces air through several acoustic sound-generating devices to a funnel directed at the viewer, issuing a series of discordant noises—the frog’s mating call. Because the mating call is the only language in which the frog is able to communicate, this first moment of “contact” between human and frog is loaded with absurd sexual innuendo. Monstrous yet alluring, the work reorganizes the hierarchical relationship between human and animals, albeit with a humorous twist.
Conley’s investigations locate the intersection of science, philosophy, art, technology, and the improbable. Reinterpreting information into an analogue of its original source, Conley transforms our assumptions of the natural world into limitless questions.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/Conley_crop-470x470.jpg

He currently lives and works in Berlin.
Arturo Herrera´s multilayered body of work includes collages, painted wood sculptures, photographs, cut felt pieces and wall works. Using a fragmented language – whose lingering references range from popular culture to art history – to decontextualize inherent narratives without eradicating the coded referentiality of the image. The resulting works shift in between the explicit and the implicit. A pliability of meaning is played out trough the ambiguity of figurative and abstract forms. These forms do not enforce a specific message. Instead, they address the fragmentation and recomposition of mass-cultural elements to explore the impact of the adultered language of abstraction into the collective gaze.
Herrera’s site specific installations in 2017 can be found at the Officine Grandi Riparazioni / OGR in Turin; Bloomberg European Headquarters in London; and at the West Elm building at 8366 Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles in conjunction with the exhibition How to Read El Pato Pascual: Disney’s Latin America and Latin America’s Disney organized by the MAK Center for Art and Architecture. In 2016, Tate Modern commissioned Herrera to create a long-term wall painting for the sixth-floor restaurant.
Herrera’s solo and project-based exhibitions have been held at Haus am Waldsee, Berlin; Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, UK; Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, UK; The Art Institute of Chicago, IL; The Aldridge Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, CT; daadgalerie, Berlin; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; CGAC, Santiago de Compostela, Spain; Dia Center for the Arts, NY; Art Gallery of Ontario; ICA Philadelphia; The UCLA Hammer Museum, MoMA, NY; and The Renaissance Society of the University of Chicago.

Holland holds an M.F.A. in ceramic sculpture from the University of Massachusetts, North Dartmouth and a B.A. in ceramics and painting from Bennington College in Vermont. She has been an artist-in-residence at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art, Omaha, NE and is currently an adjunct professor at San Antonio College.
Holland has exhibited her work throughout Texas, including one-person exhibitions in San Antonio at San Antonio College (1998): ArtPace (1998); Cactus Bra Gallery (1998); House Space (1997); and Milagros Contemporary Art (1996). Group exhibitions have taken place at Blue Star Art Space, San Antonio; The Arlington Museum of Art, TX; and the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art. James Gallery, Houston, TX represents her work.
Holland’s background as a sculptor and ceramicist inform her use of materials and approach to working with mass and volume. In recent years, she has been working almost exclusively with wax, creating minimalist paintings and objects. Concurrently, her investigations of space have resulted in poetic site-specific installations involving unexpected materials: a gallery space bisected by a screen of dental floss, an isolated, gilded stone in a house’s wall, yellow roses lining the crack between a wall and a floor in a dilapidated warehouse. Heightening architectural history, natural light and sense of smell, Holland’s spatial interventions transform mystery and discovery into matter.

He came to prominence in the early 1980s as a founding member of the Sankofa Film/Video Collective, a seminal U.K. group that explored new ways of representing black identity. Isaac Julien’s connection to ArtPace began in 1999. In that year he was chosen as an ArtPace resident, and while in San Antonio produced The Long Road to Mazatlán (1999), a work that went on to earn him a Turner Prize nomination in 2000.
From his critically acclaimed documentaries Looking for Langston (1989) and BaadAsssss Cinema (2002), to his multi-channel installations Paradise Omeros (2002) and altimore(2003), Julien’s work combines dreamlike rhythms and lush imagery in stylized narratives. His films subvert the cinematic gaze to address issues of immigration, race, gender, desire, and the politics of representation.
Widely considered to be one of Britain’s foremost contemporary artists, Isaac Julien has exhibited extensively around the world. Paradise Omeros debuted at Documenta11 in Kassell, Germany. Julien has had solo exhibitions at such venues as the Tate Gallery, London, England; the Aspen Art Museum, CO; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, IL; the BildMuseet, Umeå, Sweden; and the MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, MA. Julien has also served as a visiting lecturer at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA and is a 2001 recipient of both the Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts and the Frameline Lifetime Achievement Award (2002).",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/IsaacJ.jpg

The relationship between sound and image is central to Marclay’s work. He often incorporates music and musical instruments and has made sculptures from discarded CDs, melted vinyl records, sewn record covers together to create mixed media works, and created installations featuring musical instruments from museum collections. Performing and recording music is also an integral part of Marclay’s work. Using phonograph records as his “musical instruments,” he mixes altered records on multiple turntables in a display of precise manipulations. He has performed throughout Europe, Japan, Canada and the United States and has collaborated with many composers and musicians including Elliott Sharp, John Zorn, the Kronos Quartet, and Sonic Youth.
Marclay’s sculptures and installations have been exhibited in museums and galleries internationally, including solo exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; and The Clocktower/PS 1, New York.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/CMarclay_proc_001_crop-470x470.jpg

PA in 1956.  He received his BFA from the Kansas City Art Institute and his MFA in sculpture from CalArts. From the late 1970s until her death in 1995, Ziegler collaborated with his partner, Kate Ericson. Their projects created new vocabularies for making art in public spaces, by involving community, examining history and responding to specific sites.
The works or Ericson and Ziegler have been exhibited in a range of venues, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Real Art Ways, Hartford, CT; and Capp Street Project, San Francisco, CA. Their works were included in the 1989 Whitney Biennial; the 1991 “Places With A Past” public art component at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC; Sculpture Chicago’s 1993 “Culture in Action” project; and the 1999 Museum of Modern Art exhibit, “The Museum is Muse.”
The public nature of Ziegler’s work continues the themes and forms established with Ericson over the course of their collaboration. Sites and histories are methodically researched, as in the case of Camouflaged History for the Spoleto Festival, in which a house was painted in a camouflage pattern in 72 paint colors designated as the “authentic colors of historic Charleston” by the Charleston Historic Society. Projects generally involved public space: in San Francisco, the artists inscribed roofing shingles with San Francisco’s street names and then re-roofed a neighborhood house with the transformed materials.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/MZiegler_proc_009_crop-470x470.jpg

Since the early 1990s, Liisa Roberts has produced a number of films and installations incorporating film, which blur the line between media art and sculpture. Roberts’ work investigates what has been described as the “ethical dimension of images”–looking at the way images affect the individual’s experience in society while researching the material aspects of the image itself. Her installations have used the projected image and the screen to create a space that is unfamiliar, resembling neither the white cube of the gallery nor the flat screen to be viewed by a passive audience. Like the movement of a film in which one frame follows another, the viewer’s passage through one of her installations unfolds a series of physical and conceptual experiences.
New York-based Liisa Roberts was born in Paris in 1969 and received her BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design. Since the early 1990s, Roberts has exhibited internationally, including group exhibitions at Artists Space, New York; Helsinki Kunsthalle and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, Finland; The Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, England; P.S.1, Long Island City, NY; Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY; and Bildmuseet Umeå, Umeå, Sweden.

His principal strategies are: the transformation of common objects into other recognizable objects, extreme scale shifts, and the juxtaposition of disparate materials and images. Using architecture as a raw material, he often carves into walls to retrieve material needed to build other objects. It is a means to make literal connections between the architecture and the resulting object or to reveal aspects of their respective natures. He is interested in architecture for its constructed nature—that it is built primarily for the human body, and it can be a potent stand-in for “the institution” whether it is the home, the gallery, or the museum.
Chris Sauter was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1971. He has a BA from the University of the Incarnate Word and an MFA from The University of Texas at San Antonio. He exhibits nationally and internationally with solo exhibitions at John Michael Kohler Arts Center, Sheboygan, WI; Cueto Project, New York; Finesilver, Houston; Elizabeth Dee, New York; Galerie Valerie Cueto, Paris; and Susanne Vielmetter, Los Angeles Projects.

Mona Hatoum’s work is both deeply personal and quietly political, investigating her individual and cultural relationships with contemporary social injustices. Grounded in feminism and with a sensitive global approach, she has employed minimalist tools to present formal and social concerns, examining issues of subjectivity, emotional space and the human body. Using metaphor and poetry, found material and fabricated objects, her evocative works offer viewers their own experience as they read and contemplate her enigmatic expressions.

She also participated in the Aperto Section of the 1993 Venice Biennale.
Photographer Laura Aguilar has investigated portraiture since she emerged in the late 1980s. Her stark black-and-white photographs document subjects whose images and stories are under-represented in mainstream culture—people of color, gays and lesbians and large people. Her portraits are known for their collaborative sensibility—the subjects are encouraged to investigate and negotiate with the artist from both sides of the lens. In the late 1990s, Aguilar turned the camera on herself, making dramatic nude self-portraits in which her body is contrasted with the rough terrain of the desert landscape and in which the body and landscape become one. The works continue her efforts to challenge societal assumptions about beauty, offering an alternative to the airbrushed, artificial depictions of women generated by advertising and media.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/LAguilar_proc_004_crop-470x470.jpg

Incorporating signage, glitter, cardboard, cookies, and postcards, he questions the divisions between high and low art by intermingling their conventions. In recent projects he has focused on signage and product design, two preeminent elements of contemporary popular culture. For his contribution to the Havana Biennial in 2003, Diaz played with the wildly successful marketing strategy used to advertise New York City — “I ♥ New York”–by creating beach balls, towels, tote bags, and cards featuring the phrase “I  Cuba” and handing them out for free. The piece both pointed toward the commodification of American life and explored the very different system of exchange of the island country of Cuba.
Diaz received an M.A. from the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY, in 1999.

Hoffmann makes art by reinventing the architecture of a gallery, library or other environment as part of her finished work.  A similar installation by the artist, recently presented in Gallery 14 at the Queensland Art Gallery in Brisbane Australia, was described by Timothy Morrell, the exhibition’s curator, in the accompanying catalogue:
This installation is… an absolute part of the existing architecture.  Although plasticine is applied to surfaces, no object has been added.  Individual elements of the design…are duplicated in a veneer of plasticine.  The monochrome interior is re-projected back onto itself in bright color…restating but subverting the original architectural logic.

She completed her degree at UCLA and later attended the MFA program at Otis Art Institute. She was a faculty member at Cal Arts and Otis College of Art and Design, and has been a visiting faculty member at many other universities and art colleges throughout the country.
Sun’s earliest works combined her aesthetic interests through room-scaled installations and multi-media performances. In Los Angeles, she collaborated with important directors and composers in expressing ideas that had narrative and visual presence utilizing sound, music, light, movement and sculptures. She gave a political direction to her early elliptical, multi-media installations commenting on the plight of Chinese railroad workers and agricultural laborers in California, offering incidents and poetic images to create metaphors of the past to showcase their relationship to contemporary life. The installations were presented at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in Santa Monica, Capp Street Project in San Francisco, the Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach, and the List Visual Arts Center at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
She has exhibited internationally and her large scale multi-media installation UnderGround is in the permanent collection at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Her awards include two NEA fellowships, a Getty Fellowship for the Visual Arts, a Silver Award from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (for the MOCA produced radio version of L.A./ River/China/Town), a Vesta Award from the Woman’s Building and a Honor Award (for Robert Kennedy Inspiration Park) from the Westside Urban Forum in Los Angeles.
Beginning in 1990, Sun has spent two decades creating permanent installations for public and civic spaces throughout the United States, including the terrazzo floor for the security checkpoint area of the San Antonio International Airport that was completed in 2004. She titled it Walking the River. Other public art commissions include the Robert Kennedy Inspiration Park at the site of the former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, Union Station Gateway Center in downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood and Western Red Line Subway Station in Hollywood, Culver City’s City Hall, and a public plaza for Boston’s Chinatown (part of the Rose Kennedy Greenway).

She graduated from Queensland College of the Arts where she studied film and video production. Since relocating to Sydney in 1983, Moffatt has worked as independent filmmaker, photographer, and curator.
Moffatt has received international acclaim as an experimental filmmaker. Her short film, Night Cries: A Rural Tragedy, was selected for official competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 1990. In 1993, a feature length film entitled Bedevil was also selected for competition. For this film, which is a trilogy of ghost stories, Moffatt reportedly “raided the family closet,” embroidering on stories she had heard as a child. Moffatt has directed several music videos, including one for the rock group INXS in 1993 which was screened worldwide by MTV.
Like Moffatt’s films, her photographic work, which ranges from the glamorous to the erotic to the autobiographical, is nearly always narrative. Elaborately staged sets and multicultural casts also recall her film work. Moffatt’s photographs are represented in major public and private collections throughout Australia. She has been included in numerous individual and group exhibitions at such institutions as the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Contemporary Art in Glasgow, Scotland, the National Gallery of Victoria, The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney.

After achieving acclaim as an artist in Europe, Messager has come to the attention of museums and galleries worldwide. In 1995 her work appeared at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the Los Angeles County Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
Art in America, March 1994, comments that Annette Messager “seems to treat taxidermy and photography as interchangeable in their capacity to preserve living things for eternity.” For her installations, Messager uses dead birds and animals, photographs, stuffed toy animals, knitted garments, and written words which appear to unravel like so much yarn on the wall. The artist deconstructs and then reconfigures the world, working in series with names like Effegies, My Trophies, and Voluntary Tortures. According to French critic Mo Gourmelon, “the works of Annette Messager do not necessarily go hand in hand with the morbid, although they seem to rub shoulders with it.” He further suggests that her work exists “between the lightness of a daydream and the darkness of a nightmare.”
Messager is an inveterate collector of objects and images. She arranges them in relationship to each other in ways which jar the viewer. She also deals with fragments of the human body, inquiring into the nature of human identity and the role of women in society, including her own.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/AnnetteMessager_InProg008_crop-470x470.jpg

His bibliography lists shows in major museums and galleries across this country and in Europe, including solo exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., and the Renaissance Society in Chicago. A major survey of his work was held at the Guggenheim Museum in February 1995, curated by Nancy Spector.
Gonzalez-Torres is known for his use of simple materials to express often complex, even conflicting notions. His medium is paper, pieces of wrapped candy, a string of lights, or a beaded curtain. The environment for his work can be the cityscape surrounding one of his billboards – this is his “outdoor art,” he specifies, not public art. “Just because it’s out on the street doesn’t make it public.” Or his audience may be the individual collector who purchases an empty box on the promise that the artist will fill it – over time – with objects. Gonzalez-Torres’ work is exhibited in museums and art galleries, reaching the usual audience through unusual means. He arranged stacks of paper, sheets of which were available to anyone who wanted to take them. The unlimited edition of paper was then replenished from time to time, maintaining the work within the artist’s required parameters. The artist said, “I want my artwork to look like something else, non-artistic yet beautifully simple.”
According to Simon Watney, London-based critic and writer:
Gonzalez-Torres finds and mobilizes materials which may function as analogies for experience and emotions which are not “explained” in any extended biographical supplementary exegesis. They are works about love, desire, loss, death, and mourning… They encourage us to make as many associative connections as we like in relation to the materials assembled before us, as well as in relation to previous work.
The possibilities seem endless. The artist’s work reflects sensitivity to his Hispanic roots, but does not conform to a predetermined cultural persona or preoccupation; his work confronts issues related to his gay identity through elegant metaphor.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/FGT-detail_sm_crop-470x470.jpg

Twelve years later, the now New York- and San Antonio-based artist returns in this exhibition of his conceptually driven sculpture and two-dimensional works. New projects are combined with seminal pieces from the past, tracing the artist’s investigation of text, repetition, and communication. The works present a minimalist aesthetic endowed with cultural and emotional inquiries into how ideas of art and beauty are transferred and coded.
Jesse Amado was born in San Antonio, TX, in 1951 and received his MFA from The University of Texas at San Antonio, TX, in 1990. Since that time he has been awarded a visual arts fellowship grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and artist-in-residence grants from the Fabric Workshop in Philadelphia (through the NEA) and the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in Nebraska. He has had solo exhibitions at Finesilver, San Antonio, TX (2003); McNay Museum of Art, San Antonio, TX (2003); and Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, TX (1996). Group exhibitions include Never Leaving Aztlan, Museo de las Americas, Denver, CO (2005); Visualizing Identity, Blanton Museum of Art, Austin, TX (2003); and Film Revival, Dorsky Gallery Curatorial Program, Long Island City, NY (2003).
Frances Colpitt: Could you talk a little bit about your installation and how you conceive of its unfolding?
Jesse Amado: Well, I think I should be able to. I want to attempt to get through a lot of things that I feel are trapped inside. It has to do with a societal syntax and with a personal syntax, and most of all with a visual syntax. The theme is the washing and the cleansing of all of those things. So, I want to go through the process of cleansing, and more importantly, I hope that the poetics of the works will also be something much more, ultimately.
FC: One of the main ingredients in this exhibition is soap, and it seems very much like the kind of material that you would choose. Were you attracted to the soap because of its smell and its sense of waxy tactility?
JA: The idea of the soap is for all those reasons: the tactile quality of it, the smell of it, particularly this soap that I am using. Just taking it out of one box and putting it into another was quite an experience because it is an incredibly strong smelling soap. Then, there is the whole notion of washing, which is something I like to do. I like to wash up. Another thing that sort of was a revelation was a botanica in my new neighborhood. I told you about the place that I am getting ready to move into. My neighbor is a botanica. So, I went in there and there was a wonderful display of about one hundred different soaps that one can get in order to wash oneself with the hope of, perhaps, having a better love life. There are so many soaps that are available through this botanica to use to cleanse yourself, and to wash away the things that are impure and that are keeping you from being happier, I suppose. And the packaging of this soap is really beautiful too. So that convinced me once I saw that. I was wanting to change my work, to reevaluate it, to see what was wrong with it and what was strong about it. I thought the perfect metaphor for that would be to just wash away everything that had ever been accumulated in my work.
FC: One of the things I was going to ask you is whether your work responds to the place of its making. And now I see that although the work appears very cool and conceptual–and it appears to be homeless in a way–there are reference points in your living in San Antonio.
JA: Yes, that is very true. I am essentially tethered to this area for many reasons: because of my family, and because of my job most of all. I made the commitment to stay in this town a long time ago, but I also made a commitment to art and so I had to find a way of making a substantial art or meaningful art. One way of doing that was to refer to what San Antonio is and the pleasures that San Antonio has to offer in terms of its imagery and in terms of the kind of things that surrounded me when I was a child. You know the iconography of San Antonio is very prevalent, and I know that this plays an important part in my work even though it is not very evident, but it does derive from that.
FC: Maybe it is more metaphorical than it is formal. Your work does not reflect what we would call the indigenous style of San Antonio.
JA: The formal part of the work is important. So I do not forget about that, but I also want to stress the metaphorical aspect of it. I think of my work in very poetic terms. Poetry is very important to me….
FC: In this particular work or installation, the soap is the generative object–the motif of the show–and then you will also be using mirrors and glass.
JA: Real shiny, reflective kind of things.
FC: And the sink in the middle.
JA: It will actually be mounted on a table. And that will drain into a trough, where the soapy water will accumulate. So it will be a whole process of having the soaps in their boxes, I think, and then maybe having soaps out of their boxes, then the soaps being picked up and used to wash with, and put into another compartment. There is a ritualistic, ordered aspect of the washing that I hope to accomplish. The reason that I have the mirror is because I want to see myself going through the process of washing during the installation. Also, because of its reflection, the mirror emphasizes the duality of things. If I can see my “dual” self, I can remove myself instead of focusing on myself. If I can be beside myself, by using the mirror, and see myself doing what I am doing, it will probably help me get to the place I am hoping to get to.
FC: Is it an autobiographical exhibition?
JA: Of course it starts there and I am the author of what is going on there. But I am trying to distance myself as quickly as I possibly can, and through the mirrors I will be able to achieve that. Hopefully when the act is finished and when the viewers come in, they can see themselves as well, and possibly see something more than themselves. They can see how they are when they are beside themselves.
FC: Something that I have noticed about your work is that it is not just the objects, but the space between them that is very important. So even though there are individual pieces, there is an activation and utilization of all the space, which becomes charged.
JA: Yeah, I try to put myself in the place of the viewer and I try to create a distance between myself and the work as soon as I possibly can. I try to become the viewer suddenly, instead of maker. I try to go through the movement that a viewer would, and I kind of like that part of the process. I think about activating the viewer, whether I want to keep him still or make him move. There has to be some kind of movement. There has to be some kind of outside force that I think that the art work needs to complete it. The activation is essentially important. I try to come to it as soon as possible.
FC: Are you shifting roles? Are you artist and then viewer, and then artist and then viewer?
JA: Yes, and gradually I remove myself almost completely as the artist. I just want to give up the work as soon as I possibly can. I feel much better about the work if I can do that.

Started in 2007 in the small oil town of Big Lake, Texas by public school teacher Ryan Sprott and artist Jason Reed, the project has worked in various and fluid ways with a few hundred participants to date, each of whom has been an integral part of our work. Among them include young women navigating between Native American tradition and urban culture in Albuquerque, East Asian and African refugees new to America and searching for a sense of place in San Antonio, young men who ranch in Mexico on the weekends but call Presidio, Texas home, or undergrads at Washington and Lee University touring our Northern Triangle traveling exhibition and mapping out their family migration stories. The collective in Borderland Collective, therefore, references a mindset rather than a set group of members, allowing for ever-evolving modes of practice and perspective. Borderland Collective projects are archived at Texas State University, have been exhibited in galleries and public spaces in Texas, Arizona, Illinois, New York, Washington D.C, and Mexico City, and have been shared through lectures and publications across the globe.

She studied sculpture and painting with residencies in Italy and stays in Austria and France where museum studies and art workshops enhanced her education and perception. After earning her Master’s degree in Munich, she went on to live and work in Japan, London and Brazil. Immersing herself consciously in so many diverse cultures has left its distinct mark on her artwork and mindset. Her art speaks powerfully through the juxtaposition of disparate elements and is an expression of the artist’s transcultural identity.  It exudes a calm balance of process and concept.
Senft has won recognition with several awards, including the 2015/16 Rick Liberto Award for Visual Art and Artist Foundation of San Antonio Grant. Her work has been exhibited and collected nationally in CA, NY, RI, KS, TX and IL- and internationally in Japan, Germany, Colombia, Austria, the U.K. and Brazil.

The gift will increase the number of artworks in the Linda Pace Foundation’s collection from 620 to approximately 800. Artpace and the Linda Pace Foundation, while separate organizations, were both founded by the late Linda Pace (1945-2007), to foster the appreciation and advancement of contemporary art. Artpace, is renowned for its International Artist-in-Residence program, funded in part by the Linda Pace Foundation, which invites artists from around the world to live and work at Artpace, while creating new works of art.
“The Linda Pace Foundation is proud of our relationship with Hare & Hound Press, which over the years has assisted many artists from all over the world who have participated in Artpace’s phenomenal artist residency program,” said Foundation Vice President, Jan Jarboe Russell. Works by former Artpace resident artists, including Arturo Herrera, Shahzia Sikander, Teresita Fernandez, and Chuck Ramirez, represent a portion of the Linda Pace Foundation’s collection of paintings, sculpture, installations, and videos, including many pieces acquired in the year in which they were created.
The Hare & Hound Press gift adds depth to the Foundation’s collection and will include Wangechi Mutu’s series titled Histology of the Different Classes of Uterine Tumors from 2005-2006 and numerous production prints from films owned by the Foundation of Isaac Julien, such as Baltimore, Paradise (Omeros), and Long Road to Mazatlan.
“Hare & Hound Press has been in the business of helping artists realize their visions in various print media for 22 years. It has been our pleasure and privilege to have worked with many Artpace artists over the years. In some cases we printed unique works for their exhibitions at Artpace, and in other cases we printed editions of their works. It is our printer’s proofs from those editions that are being exhibited in the Hudson (Show) Room starting January 15, 2015 in honor of Artpace’s 20th anniversary, and in honor of my friend Linda Pace. Her Foundation, which is carrying on her support of contemporary art, is the perfect institution for our gift of printer’s proofs since it will enhance their collection of works by many of the same artists,” said Janet Flohr of Hare & Hound Press.

They often draw upon the styles, techniques, and technologies of the theatrical arts and cinema to achieve multisensory engagement, eliciting a range of sensations and memories that suggest how everyday experiences are constructed by the human mind in relationship to the external filters-including media and other technical methods of representation-through which we view and construe reality.

Inspired by the work of Egon Schiele, he reexamines the romantic, emotionally charged gestures found in early Modernist painting. He frequently works on raw and primed newspaper as his canvas, selecting and redrawing figures from art history and fashion magazines and offsetting them with abstract imagery and collage. His choice of organic, low-cost materials, such as newspaper, not only recalls the type of media used in the Arte Povera movement from the late 1960s, but suggests a connection between the degrading effects of age that newsprint and the body share.

His earlier, cartoonish objects often addressed sexual or violent imagery constructed with industrially produced medium-density fiberboard (MDF), lending them a cool, machine-produced aura. Recently he has transitioned from these brightly colored, flatly painted sculptures to more self-consciously handmade and organic pieces rendered in dark earth tones that emphasize their materiality. This, along with increasingly theatrical elements, such as refashioning the environment in which the works are shown, demonstrates Ronay’s shift from a cynical critique of contemporary popular culture to a more metaphysical investigation of primitivism, archetypes, and spirituality.

His diverse projects address recurring interests in repetition, classification, and the practices of reading and translating.

Yet, where Minimalist and Conceptual strategies of the United States in the 1960s and 1970s were often dry and mechanical, this artist’s body of work has emotive and romantic qualities not usually associated with those movements.

His recent bodies of work have fallen under the meta-title of The World Stage, reflecting the artist’s travel to locations around the globe where he establishes “satellite studios.” Working in each temporary space, Wiley creates a series of paintings deeply informed by the surrounding environment. These works incorporate the cultural milieu of the country or region where they are conceived, reflecting the indigenous artistic traditions and popular imagery.
Wiley was born in Los Angeles, CA, in 1977. He received an MFA from the Yale School of Art, New Haven, CT, in 2001.

Her tragicomic situations suggest the futility of personal and cultural ritual as they bring to the foreground issues of feminine identity and fear of success.
While occasionally humorous, Gilmore’s performances have a more serious subtext: the daunting, often self-subverting obstacles that many women face. Subjecting herself to precarious situations while wearing clothing incongruous with her circumstances, Gilmore persistently and methodically labors onward, sometimes negotiating her own sculptural tableaus as she encounters life’s many perils in heels, dresses, and makeup.

At once gestural and reductive, his works amplify strategies first explored by modernist artists in the early 20th century. Deeply rooted in a fascination with how visual abstract codes represent a means of abbreviated, if not universal, communication, Carter’s free-form compositions are simultaneously non-objective and referential.
Playful at first impression, Carter’s art contains allusions to mundane yet foreboding engagements, such as radio transmissions, encoded transcriptions, and other electronic communications that serve not only to link us to world networks, but also to place us under surveillance and deprive us of our privacy. Often our dependence on these tools and the despair that results from their failure to properly operate is a recurring leitmotif in his work.
Nathan Carter was born in Dallas, TX, in 1970 and currently lives and works in New York, NY. He received his MFA from Yale University, New Haven, CT, in 1999.

Each project graphically reduces source material such as a 1930s crime scene captured by infamous news photographer Weegee or the memorable on-screen terror of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? to explore the mutable role of the camera and photograph in the reception and understanding of reality.
Ezawa’s schematic renderings, realized through hand-tracing and computer manipulation, stage a critique of photography without actually presenting it. The resulting cartoon-like representations focus on human details, such as lips or eyes, while sky or clothing remains undistinguished. Ezawa’s simplified versions of photographs, which are themselves already subjective takes on the real, paradoxically amplify emotive content and create a hyper-real.
Based in San Francisco, CA, Kota Ezawa was born in Cologne, Germany in 1969. He received his MFA from Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, in 2003.

Meticulously constructed from material that is often used to support, rather than create, art in the studio (words, tape, glassine, magazines), the images conceptually and materially consider the complicated and fraught nature of artistic creation.

Often perplexing, the works reflect an ethereal outlook in which sound and visual expression are not confined to disparate realms but join forces to affect experience.
The potency of Donnelly’s projects comes from this oscillation. Whether sketching the aural sensation of a beating drum, suggesting that human hand signals can create rain miles away, or asking an audience to close their eyes and listen to “the sound that stops time,” the pieces drift in and out of grasp. Riding alongside the quotidian, they make visible currents that often go unnoticed.
Like the poetry of John Ashbery that she admires, the artist’s works intoxicate by pivoting between exquisite representations of the everyday and complex inscriptions of other dimensions. The projects confidently resist questioning—drawings simply do extend through walls and musical notes have corporeal presence.
Donnelly’s artworks heighten awareness of the immaterial and articulate the wonder of what is. Instead of engaging in a dialogue about belief, her poetic projects dip into romanticism and test assumptions to expose myths about existence and the power and possibilities of art.",https://artpace.org/wp-content/uploads/TDonnelly_crop-470x470.jpg

The works push the medium’s boundaries by using unconventional material to investigate the linguistic and visual lives of found items. Each project begins with a visually compelling object that is flattened, framed, and classically studied from multiple perspectives. The colorful drawings and collages are shown alongside the result: large-scale patchwork abstractions based on the original but composed out of fabric.
In the images wools, felts, and corduroys combine to create creamy whites, rich expanses of color, and antiquated lettering that hint at the artist’s Cuban mother’s quilting, her father’s love of design, and her experience of the graphic sensibility of America. Referencing diverse fields such as Pop, ready-mades, folk, and advertising, the projects challenge modernist ideas of what painting can be and propose that context determines when the castoff or the commercial becomes art.

Drawing on his urban upbringing and Cuban heritage, Gispert creates unlikely scenarios that collide such seemingly disparate worlds.
In the photographic series Cheerleaders (2001) ghetto-fabulous cheerleaders—adorned with delicate tattoos, airbrushed nails, and platinum jewelry—are arranged into fantastical poses that connect the history of painting with the baroque nature of hip-hop signifiers. The images explore cultural adaptation, and the inevitable intermingling of past and present.
In Goddess, a lip-sticked girl beatifically levitates against a chromakey green background. Her eyes are serenely closed, yet her face is burdened by over-sized hip-hop earrings. The girl gestures to the heavens with her bracelet-laden wrist like a figure from a religious painting—but also like an urban teen throwing gang signs. Gispert’s goddess sports a gold-plated gun charm where her painted counterpart would have worn a crucifix. In this work, as in the others, old school and new school co-mingle to create something in-between.

Painted from digital and composite photographs, his compositions depict images of the sublime to the banal, questioning at which point one might become the other.
In many of his works Rostovsky details a breadth of nature the naked eye could not possibly take in. Transport Series; Star Trek I (2000) features a star-studded galaxy exploding with colorful hot spots and points of light. The painting is an awe-inspiring portrayal of the universe, yet, simultaneously its title gestures toward a quotidian element of life that seems to lie at the other end of the spectrum.
At times Rostovsky works in the opposite direction: he elevates the ordinary. In Carrie (2002) blood drips down the face of the wide-eyed woman from the cult classic. By placing this pop culture image in the rarefied context of visual art, Rostovsky suggests such familiar markers of our times might soon become the markers of history.
Born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1970, Peter Rostovsky moved to the United States in 1980. He received a BA and BFA from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY in 1995. He participated in the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program, New York, NY the following year.

Through a variety of media—sculpture, painting, performance, and photography—she has consistently explored issues of wealth and excess, body image and beauty.
While in college Rossell developed a photographic project that poignantly confronts these issues—the series became known as Ricas y Famosas. Over the years she has taken thousands of images that feature the (mostly) young and blond nouveau riche of Mexico in their opulent homes. Rossell began by taking photos of her extended family to help pass the time she spent in their world. She became intrigued with these documents of how people choose to live and present themselves, and soon broadened her scope from her relatives to their friends.
The project continued until 2002, when the artist published a book collecting over seventy images. For Rossell the works are most potent in this intimate, portable form. The viewer is able to sit on her own couch, flip back and forth between images, and reflect upon how signs of taste and prosperity differ depending on class and culture.
Daniela Rossell has had solo exhibitions at the University of Salamanca, Spain (2003); Greene Naftali Inc., New York, NY (2000); and Galeria OMR, Mexico City, Mexico (1996).

His works further the investigations of representation and language explored by artists in the Conceptual movement of the 1970s.

Ann Stautberg experiments with the medium of photography, specifically, with the effects of hand-tinting black and white photographs. Her skills as a photographer and painter are clearly evidenced by her precise printing and the steady hand of her brush. Stautberg’s work is unusually large-scale, almost painterly, in contrast to the more intimate hand-tinted photographs from the turn of the century. Her work solidly references this period of photography, when photographs were used as souvenirs of travel, rather than tools of expression.

Now living in San Antonio with his wife and two daughters, he spends his days as a stay-at-home parent. He also operates and manages Werk House SA, a converted studio space which functions as an Airbnb short-term rental space and art gallery.
Gonzalez is often inspired by being a stay-at-home father, construction, challenging stereotypes, abstract expressionism, and finding beauty in chaos. His work ranges from detailed drawings of construction scenes on concrete to colorful abstract installations made of cardboard and duct tape, or drawings of his day-to-day life.
Gonzalez has a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting (Magna Cum Laude) from the University of Houston, and a Master of Fine Arts in Painting from the University of Texas at San Antonio.

Her earlier works were based in mixed media installations and drawings made of light. More recently, her works are more abstract and use light as a field of energy. These and other artworks give rise to multiple interpretations on the perceptual level through a relationship between the intensity of physical stimuli and their perceptual effects, shaping our beliefs of what we are seeing. Cunningham Little’s works are meditative and potentially extend the visual thought and experience, encouraging viewers to reflect upon their understanding and interpretation of the physical world that surrounds them.
Cunningham Little studied at nationally recognized art schools including Pilchuck Glass School, Penland School of Art and Craft, and the University of Texas in San Antonio. Since 1983 Cathy has run a business in San Antonio called Cunningham Glass Studios, LLC, specializing in client commissions for Stained Glass, Neon, Etched Glass and other glass related products.

Allen often employs time and site specific investigation to capture the ephemeral qualities of his subjects. In his extended exposure photographs, the artist captures elegant light trails spiraling through a variety of environments ranging from grand ballrooms to nocturnal landscapes. According to the artist, his kite installations expose “vital relationships between artist and environment, form and space, nature and culture.”[2] Allen’s work poignantly articulates subtle variations in the world around us, combining science and nature with art and expression.

Acting as a catalyst for meditation, her site-specific interventions employ the minutiae of everyday life, guiding viewers toward introspective interaction with her works. In Fortune, 2004, the artist inserted 1,000 folded cards, each printed with the words “longing” and “belonging,” into randomly selected library books. This emotive intervention disrupted the otherwise contemplative setting of a library, making those who discovered the cards oddly self-aware. The project thus transcends the conventional artist/viewer exchange to make evident the universal language of associative memory.

For Tosser (2005) the artist constructed a booth that instructed perplexed participants to “offer” the attendant a personal item, story, or secret. In exchange they could try their hand at a ring toss, throw darts at a balloon, or soak the artist. For Flat Mac (2005) Wallace painted a plywood casket with festive red and white stripes and printed on its lid: Carry Me Out Flat, Bury Me Standing. Heightening the sense of macabre spectacle, the contraption was theatrically lit and threatened to spill its contents while rolling down the incline upon which it was propped.

For a public commission at a newly built San Antonio bus transfer, Shipton tinted the station’s windows blue, yellow, red, and green, and applied the words “GRACE,” “LISTEN,” “TALK,” and “FORWARD.” These evocative gestures both softened and activated the otherwise stagnant waiting room, encouraging interaction between the waiting strangers.
